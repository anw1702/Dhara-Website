## PRD for Dhara Landing Page Development

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on creating a pixel-perfect landing page for the Dhara supply chain financing application using SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS. The landing page will serve as the initial point of contact for potential users and should effectively communicate the value proposition of Dhara.

**Design Reference**

The design specifications for the landing page are outlined in the Figma file:

* **Dhara Website:** [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/design/H3RlTOuGCU6OctkLzokVf2/Ganak-%26-Dhara-COPY?node-id=3-2297&t=F0ZNjcJh9S2lmYu5-0)

**Development Tools**

* SvelteKit: A framework for building reactive web applications with Svelte
* Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

**Deliverables**

* A fully functional landing page for Dhara, adhering to the design specifications in the Figma file.
* A well-structured, documented, and easy-to-maintain codebase for the landing page.

**Development Process**

1. **UI Component Development:**
    * Develop reusable Svelte components for various UI elements on the landing page.
    * Ensure pixel-perfect alignment with the Figma design by utilizing techniques like:
        * Leveraging Svelte's built-in styling capabilities or a CSS preprocessor like Sass for granular control.
        * Employing layout components and utilities from Tailwind CSS to streamline the process.
2. **Layout and Routing:**
    * Structure the landing page layout using SvelteKit's routing capabilities. 
    * Define clear navigation paths and organize content sections effectively to guide users through the landing page. 
    * Consider using SvelteKit's built-in data fetching capabilities to retrieve any dynamic content required for the landing page.
3. **Content Integration:**
    * Integrate text content, images, and other media elements following the Figma design.
    * Ensure the content is clear, concise, and effectively communicates Dhara's value proposition.
    * Leverage Svelte's reactivity for any dynamic content updates that might be required.
4. **Responsiveness:**
    * Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the landing page adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
    * Utilize Tailwind CSS's built-in responsiveness features to achieve optimal results.
    * Conduct thorough testing across various devices and browsers to guarantee a consistent user experience.
5. **Interactivity:**
    * Incorporate basic interactivity features to enhance user experience, such as:
        * Button clicks for triggering actions like form submissions or navigation.
        * Form submissions for capturing user information or feedback.
        * Subtle animations (if applicable) to draw attention to specific elements or guide the user flow.
    * Ensure interactivity is implemented efficiently using Svelte's event handling mechanisms and lifecycle hooks.

**Code Quality and Maintainability**

* Write clean, well-structured, and commented code that adheres to best practices for Svelte development.
* Organize the codebase logically, separating components, styles, and any data fetching logic into distinct folders.
* Consider using a linter or code formatter to maintain code consistency and readability.
* Include a README file within the project directory that outlines the project setup, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

**Success Criteria**

* The landing page visually matches the Figma design with pixel-perfect accuracy.
* The landing page is responsive and functions flawlessly across different devices and browsers.
* The landing page effectively communicates the value proposition of Dhara and compels users to learn more about the application.
* The codebase is well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain, promoting future development and collaboration.

**Additional Notes**

* This readme focuses solely on the development of the Dhara landing page. Further functionalities or features specific to the full-fledged PWA will be addressed in separate documentation.
